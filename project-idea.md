## Crypto Portfolio Creator
1. Create an API key that draws the top 100~ or so crypto closing price data into a json format using alpaca, cryptocompare API key etc. A group API key and secret key could be used?
2. from this raw data, we will need to sort / filter it if it does not come in a desirable format using pandas if it comes in a CSV file. (I already have a potential crypto API key we could use that draws all USD and BTC paired data from binance's public API key)
3. create a dashboard which compares each alt-coins Beta, and correlation (meansured in USD) to BTC i.e over the previous 365 days
4. construct a feature that allows us to select i.e 5 or 10 cryptos and gives us the sharpe ratio, portfolio beta, portfolio correlation (and other statistics) compared to just holding a portfolio of 100% Bitcoin
